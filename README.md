# Detect Frauds in Credit Card Transaction Data

## Summary of Project
The purpose of this project is to detect potential credit card transaction fraud. There are mainly three ways that could cause credit card transaction fraud, which are lost/stolen cards, common points of compromise (merchants “steal” many cards, counterfeit cards, skimmers at gas stations, POSs, restaurants, or stores, etc.), and online account hacking. This project is conducted based on over 96,000 historical credit card transaction records with labeled fraud. The best machine learning model for the out-of-time (test) data is used to calculate the overall saving by detecting frauds. Based on the result, we would make a recommendation for where the client should set a score cutoff (OOT population % bins). This is an supervised machine learning project.
